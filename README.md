# SCDE-codes

The R scripts implements a set of statistical methods from SCDE for analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data. 

1. scde_pagoda.r   The pagoda script implemented in the scde resolves multiple, potentially overlapping aspects of transcriptional heterogeneity by identifying known pathways or novel gene sets that show significant excess of coordinated variability among the measured cells
2. scde_de.r  the scde script implements routines for fitting individual error models and call differently expressed genes for single-cell RNA-seq measurements
3. scde.sh   The job submitting bash file to SCG3
4. mergy_STAR_stat.py   The python script will mergy read count from STAR for each gene each sample to make a big matrix for SCDE
